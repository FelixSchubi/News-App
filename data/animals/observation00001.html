        <div class="rich-text">Two weeks ago, we introduced <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2016/04/tilt-brush.html">Tilt Brush</a>, a new app that enables artists to use virtual reality to paint the 3D space around them. Part virtual reality, part physical reality,
          it can be difficult to describe how it feels without trying it firsthand. Today, we bring you a little closer to the experience of painting with Tilt Brush using the powers of the web in a new Chrome Experiment titled <a href="https://virtualart.chromeexperiments.com/">Virtual Art Sessions</a>.<br>
